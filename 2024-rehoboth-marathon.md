I love running, I love running. It's a visceral, inward peace, a state of being painfully enveloped in the present. And I loved this race. It was painful, it was hard, and it was so, so beautiful.

It was my first marathon that I truly raced, and I understand the race a bit better now. It's far, farther than you think. And it deserves your utmost respect. And it will hurt. No amount of training or preparation can save you from the pain of the last few miles.

I started a bit late, so for the first couple of miles I was stuck behind a horde of people running 9-9:30 pace. In passing them, I rolled my ankle, and I got irritated and impatient. But in the grand scheme of things I didn't lose more than 10 seconds. Once I passed mile 3 I told myself to calm down.

At mile 6, I was feeling smooth and easy. I remember a flock of seagulls cawing above us. I remember wanting to push a little, but telling myself to stay patient.

At miles 11-12, we hit a turnaround point. I felt way too good. I could squeeze a little, I thought. And I did for a couple miles.

Soon after, around mile 15, I felt the effort getting harder, and myself getting slower. I told myself to relax until 20 miles, although I don't know if I actually followed this advice in the race.

At mile 17-18, on the way back on the trail, I found myself enveloped in gratitude. I was so, so happy to be there. My legs were hurting. I still had 9 miles to go. And I was so happy.

At mile 21, I was starting to feel haggard. My legs were, slowly, slowly falling apart. I was breathing like I was running a 5K, running nowhere near the pace. There was a massive headwind. Running through it felt like running through sludge. At mile 22, we turned onto another section of trail, less smooth than before. Was I going to roll my ankle? 4 miles left.

An eternity passed, and I hit the final turnaround point at mile 22.5. I felt like I was falling apart. 5k left. I had completely stopped looking at my watch at this point. All that mattered was reaching the finish line. There were a few turns, and each time I felt like I was going to keel over.

At mile 25.75, we turned onto the final stretch, and I saw the finish line. It was so far away. I tried to sprint but I had nothing in me to do so. And so I just kept running. An eternity passed, and I hit the finish line. And then I keeled over as the pain hit. I could not move. My legs were haggard. But I had done it.

Nothing could have prepared me for those last 5 miles. "Let's see what you're made of", I said. "You can do it", I said. The longest 5 miles of my life.

## Lessons

- The marathon is long, and my calibration for "marathon effort" was off. Marathon effort feels just barely above Z2. It feels like a gentle cruise, with very little feeling of a "squeeze".
- My largest bottleneck is the conditioning of my legs. I did not feel like I was breathing hard at any point, and I feel like my cardiovascular conditioning is already quite good. So the most important thing for me to work on is developing more ironclad legs.
- The part of my legs holding me back the most were my hamstrings. Maybe this is an area I can try to strengthen.
- Marathon pace felt a bit awkward for me since I haven't really practiced it. I think for the next race, I will try to dial in marathon pace a bit more, and focus on quality long runs with MP segments.

## Training
I meant to do a ~14 week block but had 2 down weeks while on vacation.

Week of:

- 8/26: 41mi, 4mi tempo
- 9/02: 35mi, 8mi MP
- 9/09: 32mi
- 9/16: 24mi, 10k race
- 9/23: 46mi, 6mi tempo
- 9/30: 49mi, 7mi tempo
- 10/07: 47mi, 4*2k threshold, 10mi MP
- 10/14: 41mi, 10k race
- 10/21: 49mi, 6 * 1k VO2
- 10/28: 52mi, 4 * 1200m, 2 * 800m VO2
- 11/04: 49mi, 4mi failed 10k, 12mi MP
- 11/11: 50mi, 6mi over-under
- 11/18: 47mi, 10k race
- 11/25: 40mi, 2 * 2k threshold + 1200, 1000, 800 VO2
- 12/02: 17mi, 3mi MP + 4 * 400 VO2

so in total, 9 weeks of consistent work with a down week and a 2-week taper. Averaged 47mi for the block, and 48.5mi without the down weeks/taper.
